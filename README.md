Regression-Random Forest
Random forest is a Supervised Learning algorithm which uses ensemble learning method for classification and regression.
Random forest is a bagging technique and not a boosting technique. The trees in random forests are run in parallel. There is no interaction between these trees while building the trees.
It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
